## Description
This directory contains the designs for the central deck, the microcontroller enclosure, and the fixtures for sensors (e.g. camera, ultrasound, encoder).

The following folders have been added to reflect the custom hardware for the ETH Zürich ZARC project:

ZARC_customPCB: the custom mounting circuit for the Adruino and IMU

ZARC_frontWheelEncoderMount: the front wheel encoder mount CAD files (parts are 3D printed)

ZARC_rearWheelEncoderMount: the rear wheel encoder mount CAD files (parts are 3D printed)

ZARC_ mountDeack: the mounting deck, used to mount the custom PCB, Odroid and USB hub to the car chassis

All folders include an image file of the associated part(s). 

All of the above parts are designed by Elias Zoller of the ETH Zürich IDSC lab (zollere@ethz.ch)
